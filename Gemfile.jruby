# All gems that aren't actually used in code should have "require: false".
# This is needed for RBS, because otherwise it will install insane number of definitions.
# Alternatively, ignore them in `rbs_collection.yaml`.

# For running tasks
gem "rake", require: false

group :test do
  # Testing framework
  gem "rspec", require: false
end
